    Unfortunately we are not a community for everyone. We are a community for developers, builders and enthusiasts of Web3, technology, programming and most importantly, Blockchain. We are not a community for people who just want to chill and have fun. We are a community for people who want to learn, grow and build together and have fun simultaneously ðŸ˜Ž (We're not numb though). We are a community for people who want to make an impact in the world of Web3. If you are one of those people, then you are in the right place.

  Well firstly, we have to decide whether we take new people or not. For now (29.04.2024) we are not taking new people.
  As the server is not built yet. But if you are a developer, builder or enthusiast of Web3, technology, programming and most importantly, Blockchain, you can message us and we will consider with the community, if we make the exception or not ðŸ˜‰

  We're not going to be a large community like (5k) members but in fact I want to keep it small and friendly.
  As the first aim we target a number of 10 members (29.04.2024).
  We want to create a community where you can actually know the people in the community and not just be a number.
  We want to create a community where you can actually make an impact on the server and not be a slave of admins and mods. We 
  want to create a community where you can actually have fun with learning and growing and not get overwhelmed, when the answers are not clear.
